# Dithereum - A Next Generation Blockchain Platform


## Introduction to the Dithereum Platform
The Dithereum Platform is a unified infrastructure platform based on the technical, traffic and ecological resources, and will be gradually open to the blockchain industry. It will make the construction of decentralized applications more efficient and cost-effective, and provide comprehensive empowerment in aspects of promotion, traffic, and resources. The Dithereum Platform is an EVM compatible blockchain who solves the biggest problem of Dapp industry. The Dithereum Platform will provide global developers with series of diverse innovative facilities and services.

## Solving market's biggest problem
​Decentralized applications (Dapps) running on any blockchain contribute to the biggest use case of the blockchain industry. Many such Dapps face cash flow problems. They have many users and lots of transactions in their smart contracts, but they do not gain anything from those transactions. All the transaction fees paid by the users go to miners (or stakers in PoS blockchain). This creates a scenario of "Rich getting richer and poor getting poorer". We solved this painful industry problem through our innovative technology, where smart contract deployers also gain some percentage of the transaction fee paid by the smart contract user. This will create a huge positive cash flow to the Dapp developers and help them run the Dapp project smoothly and they can carry on their innovative development in the blockchain ecosystem.

## Declaration
To empower the decentralised applications (Dapps) ecosystem 

## Vision
Dithereum's vision is not only to be the best public blockchain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects. Relying on the world's largest trading ecosystem, Dithereum is committed to becoming the birthplace of innovative technologies and innovative businesses, and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

## Dithereum’s Performance
- TPS: 500+
- Average block interval: 3s

## Consensus Mechanism
DPoS consensus mechanism: it has the characteristics of low transaction cost, low transaction delay, and high transaction concurrency.

The maximum number of validators supported is 21.

## Economic Model 
The endogenous token on the chain is DTH; the transactions consume DTH as gas fee.

Miners pledge DTH to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion. 

## Cross-Chain
Assets such as BTC, ETH and stable coins can be mapped to Dithereum by an asset bridge. The realization method is to lock a certain amount of tokens on the original chain then generate a corresponding number of tokens on Dithereum. 

Dithereum encourages developers to provide more decentralized cross-chain solution.  

## Meta Transaction Function
The meta-transaction function is supported, which allows users to reduce gas fees step-wise, and Dithereum will cover the payment of the reduced part. The meta-transaction function allows to minimize the migration cost of DApp developers, as well as to effectively reduce the cost of DApp users.

## Dithereum Technical Characteristics
- An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
- Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
- Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
- Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize users’ experience.
